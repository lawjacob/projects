            <a id="mindfulness"><h3><b>Mindfulness Meditation</b></h3></a>
            <p>Learning mindfulness meditation is the most straightforward and easiest. Meaning that it is very suitable for beginners to learn.</p>
            <p>To put it simply, mindfulness meditation is the basic act of being aware — or mindful — of what you are doing in the present moment. For example, you could be practicing mindfulness while you are walking your dog, brushing your teeth, or washing your dishes. </p>
            <p>That would mean you are 100% involved in the activity you are doing — and not thinking about any distractions, stressing about the past, or worrying about the future. </p>
            <p>This practice involves setting time aside to sit and focus on your breathing, and it can be as little as five minutes each day. Just find a chair, couch, or spot on the floor where you can sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. </p>
            <p>A common misconception is that mindfulness meditation involves not thinking — <b>but completely erasing all thoughts is impossible</b>. Instead, learning how to meditate is about being able to redirect your thoughts when you get distracted, and come back to your breath rather than be carried away by distractions.</p>
            <p>Once you're able to do this while practicing mindfulness meditation, the skills can translate to daily life, and you'll be able to stay more fully present for any activity, whether it's dog walking, dish washing, or something else.</p>

            <p>By improving your ability to focus in the moment, what you're actually doing is training the brain to become less affected by stress. According to the American Psychological Association, mindfulness meditation improves emotional regulation in the brain by decreasing amygdala reactivity. The amygdala is the part of the brain that controls the "fight or flight" response. By regulating this stress response, you may be able to limit anxiety, reduce
                depression, and improve self-control. </p>

            <a id="body-scan"><h3><b>Body scan meditation</b></h3></a>
            <p>Body scan meditations focus on consciously relaxing different parts of the body.</p>

            <p>You can do this by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Focus on your feet and how they feel on the floor. Breathe in, and then as you exhale, try to relax your feet.</li>

                    <li>Next, move up to your legs and notice how they feel as part of your body. Breathe in, and then as you exhale, try to relax your legs.</li>

                    <li>You can repeat this process as you move up the body, focusing on your arms, shoulders, and head. You can also start at your head and work your way down.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This type of meditation may be preferable if you have a difficult time focusing on your breath alone — it may be easier to anchor your awareness on how your body feels.</p>

                <p>In addition, body scan meditations are a great way to relieve tight shoulders or a tense neck, which often builds up as a result of stress or anxiety.</p>

                <p>The practice is also particularly helpful for those who suffer from chronic pain. For example, a 2012 study of 55 people found that those who practiced a 10-minute body scan every day for eight weeks reported a significant reduction in chronic pain.</p>

                <p>Overall, by listening to the body, practitioners become more self-aware and can also make more beneficial choices, such as increased quality of self-care and less likelihood to indulge in temporary pleasures.</p>

            <a id="walking"><h3><b>Walking meditation</b></h3></a>
            <p>Instead of using the breath as the object of awareness, walking meditation encourages you to focus on each footstep in order to be fully present.</p>

            <p>This involves becoming aware of the movement of each foot; noticing the action of lifting, lowering, and having each foot touch the ground, one step after another.</p>

            <p>Like body scan meditation, walking meditation allows you to cultivate a sense of mind-body awareness by focusing on your body's physical sensations as it moves. Walking meditation is a great substitute when you might find it difficult to sit still, because it allows you to get moving while still focusing on an object of awareness.</p>

            <p>In a 2013 study, researchers examined 75 individuals who had perceived high levels of psychological distress. They found that those who engaged in mindful walking for 10 minutes a day showed reduced levels of stress and anxiety, and overall improvement in quality of life compared to those who did not participate in mindful walking.</p>
